description: Create a new change with all artifacts needed for implementation. Automatically explores and clarifies when the request is vague before creating artifacts.
---

You are using the spx-ff skill, which is described as follows:

Create a new change — explore if needed, then generate all artifacts for implementation.

> **CLI NOTE**: Run all `openspec` and `bash` commands directly from the workspace root. Do NOT `cd` into any directory before running them. The `openspec` CLI is designed to work from the project root.

> **SETUP**: If `openspec` is not installed, run `npm i -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest`. If you need to run `openspec init`, always use `openspec init --tools none`.

**⚠️ MODE BOUNDARY RESET:** When this command is invoked, **stop any prior activity** — whether you were implementing code (`/spx-apply`), exploring (`/spx-plan`), or anything else. You are now in **change creation mode**. No code writing. No continuing prior tasks. Fresh start.

**🚫 SUBAGENT BLACKLIST:** NEVER use the `explore` or `plan` subagents. These are generic subagents from other kits and are NOT part of this workflow. Only use subagents explicitly listed in this kit (e.g., `spx-uiux-designer`). Do your own exploration and planning directly.

**Input**: A description of what to build, optionally with a kebab-case name. Can range from vague ("login page") to specific ("add JWT auth with refresh tokens using Redis session store").

---

## Phase 0: Context Check

Before evaluating the user's request, check what already exists:

```bash
openspec list --json
```

**If active changes exist**, the user might want to:
- **Create a brand new change** — proceed normally to Phase 1
- **Update an existing change's artifacts** — e.g., "I forgot to add email validation to the auth change"

**How to tell the difference:**
- User's input clearly relates to an active change → ask: "You have an active change `<name>`. Want to update its artifacts, or create a separate change?"
- User's input is unrelated to any active change → proceed to Phase 1 (new change)
- User explicitly says "new" or provides a new name → proceed to Phase 1

**If updating an existing change**: Skip `openspec new change`, go directly to Phase 2 step 3 (get status) using the existing change name. Update only the artifacts that need changes.

---

## Phase 1: Understand

Evaluate the user's input to decide the next phase.

**If no input provided**, ask what they want to build (open-ended, no preset options). Do NOT proceed without a request.

**If input provided**, assess clarity:

| Signal | Means | Next Phase |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Clear scope, known tech, specific enough to write a proposal | **Ready** | → Phase 2 (Create) |
| Vague idea, missing key decisions, multiple possible approaches, unknown constraints | **Needs exploration** | → Explore (below) |

**Bias toward action.** If you can make reasonable assumptions, go to Phase 2. Only explore when the ambiguity would lead to fundamentally wrong artifacts.

---

## Explore (when needed)

**Goal**: Get enough clarity to create good artifacts. This is NOT open-ended brainstorming — it's focused exploration with a destination.

**Subagent rule**: If you use subagents during exploration (e.g., for codebase analysis, planning), instruct them to **report findings only — no file creation**.

**Stance**: Curious, visual, grounded. Ask questions that emerge naturally. Use ASCII diagrams when they help. Investigate the codebase for context.

**What you might do:**
- Ask 2-3 clarifying questions (not an interrogation)
- Sketch the problem space with ASCII diagrams
- Investigate the codebase to surface relevant patterns, integration points, or constraints
- Compare approaches briefly if there's a real fork in the road
- Look up API docs via `spx-doc-lookup` if the approach depends on a specific library's behavior or version

**Keep it focused.** You're exploring to CREATE, not exploring to explore. When you have enough to write a solid proposal, move on.

**When sufficient clarity emerges**, present a brief summary and ask for confirmation:

```
## Ready to create

**What**: [1-2 sentence summary of the change]
**Approach**: [key technical decisions]
**Scope**: [what's in, what's out]

Create this change? (yes / discuss more)
```

- User confirms → Phase 2
- User wants to discuss more → continue exploring
- If exploration reveals this is too vague or the user just wants to think → suggest `/spx-plan` for open-ended exploration

---

## Phase 2: Create

Once the request is clear (either from input or after exploration):

1. **Derive a kebab-case name** from the description (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

2. **Create the change directory**
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```

3. **Get the artifact build order**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse: `applyRequires` (artifact IDs needed before implementation) and `artifacts` (list with status and dependencies).

4. **Create artifacts in dependency order**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress.

   For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied):
   - Get instructions: `openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json`
   - The instructions JSON includes:
     - `context`: Project background (constraints for you — do NOT include in output)
     - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you — do NOT include in output)
     - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
     - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
     - `outputPath`: Where to write the artifact
     - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
   - Read any completed dependency files for context
   - Create the artifact file using `template` as structure
   - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints — do NOT copy them into the file
   - Show brief progress: "✓ Created <artifact-id>"

   Continue until all `applyRequires` artifacts have `status: "done"`. Re-check with `openspec status` after each artifact.

   If an artifact requires user input (unclear context), ask and continue.

5. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**: Change name/location, artifacts created, and: "Run `/spx-apply` to start implementation."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `openspec instructions` for each artifact type
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use `template` as structure — fill in its sections
- **`context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file** — never copy them into output
- **Always write artifact files in English** — regardless of conversation language
- **Annotate verify points in tasks.md** — For the last task of each major group or any high-risk task, append a verify annotation: `← (verify: what to check)`. This tells the verifier WHERE to deep-check and WHAT to look for. Place annotations on tasks that are end-of-flow (everything before must work for this to work) or high-risk (complex logic, integration points, security). Example:
  ```
  1. Setup database
    1.1 Create users table
    1.2 Create sessions table
    1.3 Add migration script ← (verify: schema matches design.md, migrations run without errors)
  2. Auth endpoints
    2.1 POST /login
    2.2 POST /register
    2.3 POST /refresh-token ← (verify: all endpoints match spec scenarios, token refresh flow works end-to-end)
  ```

**Guardrails**
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's `apply.requires`)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- Prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum — only ask when critically unclear
- If a change with that name already exists, suggest continuing that change instead
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next
- **Don't over-explore** — 2-3 rounds of questions max before creating. If still unclear, create with best understanding and note assumptions in the proposal
